<h2>International Project Management (Uni-Ride)</h2>
Group size: 5 <br>
<p>The main goal of this project was to apply Project Management strategies and techniques to develop a concept for an app based 
system that supports the spontaneous identification of carpooling possibilities and to support this by an adequate marketing strategy.</p>
<p><b>Role 1: Assisted in defining User Stories</b><br>
<p>User Story 1: User is a Student, wants to find a carpool driver. <br>
John is a student studying in SRH University and stays in Speyer which is approximately 40km away from the university. 
He stays at a place where the frequency of public transport is low. Bus stops and Train stations are located far from his residence 
and therefore he looks for a carpooling application with affordable price which can help him go to university without wasting much time
commuting.</p>
