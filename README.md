<p>The main goal of this project was to apply Project Management strategies and techniques to develop a concept for an app based 
system that supports the spontaneous identification of carpooling possibilities and to support this by an adequate marketing strategy.</p>
<b>Role 1: Assisted in defining User Stories</b><br>
<p>User Story 1: User is a Student and wants to find a carpool driver. <br>
John is a student studying in SRH University and stays in Speyer which is approximately 40km away from the university. 
He stays at a place where the frequency of public transport is low. Bus stops and Train stations are located far from his residence 
and therefore he looks for a carpooling application with affordable price which can help him go to university without wasting much time
commuting.</p>

<p>User Story 2: Lisa is a student studying in University of Heidelberg and stays in St. Leon Rot which is approximately 25km away from the university. She has to regularly travel to University on Weekends for cultural committee meetings but she stays at a place where there are no buses on weekends and to reach the nearest railway station she has to walk approximately 5km. So she is looking for some carpool which can help her reach university on weekends.</p>
